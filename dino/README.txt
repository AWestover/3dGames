This is a fun game

you will play against an AI in a classic jumper game

the algorithm will genetically mutate a neural network in order to perfect its decision making process for the binary classification problem of  jump or not jump at each state (defined with simple parameters)
hopefully it will work better than the human



NOTE
bounding box MUST contain the dino feet or it wont count as a contour



use python2 for everything


(python3 open cv isn't going well...)


except pyautogui is in python3


cool functions

deadComps.sort(function(a, b){return (b.fitness-a.fitness);});
deadComps = deadComps.reverse();


pyautogui.alert etc
